## My process

-Install Vue CLI
-create components as per card using mobile first approach
-Used Tailwind Css to style my card
-hosted the site using netlify

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Vuejs](https://vuejs.org/) - Vuejs framework
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

This project has helped me learn Tailwind Css media queries were challenging and also adding linear gradient colors.
I used Axios to get the API which was something new to me.

### Continued development

I am currently learning VueJs framework and in this project I reinforced some data sharing skills between components.
I used Props to share data from parent to child. I also learnt that it's possible to share data from child to parent using( $emmit) method.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://tailwindcss.com/) - This helped me for look up the tailwind syntax for media queries and colors to style the page.
- [Example resource 2](https://vuejs.org/api/ssr.html#server-side-rendering-api) - This is an amazing Vue site which helped me finally understand how to fetch API. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
